Question #5: Array Sorting
Write an algorithm that sorts an array without using the sort() method. There are many different sorting algorithms - take the time to read about the following:

Quick sort
Merge sort
Heap sort
Insertion sort
Bubble sort
Selection sort
You may implement any of the above algorithms (or your own) to solve the problem - as long as it doesn't use sort().

Example
Input: [9, 2, 7, 12]

Output: [2, 7, 9, 12]

Sorting by numeric value beginning with smallest number and increasing to largerst number.

Bubble sort method

function sort(numArray) {
  for (let i = 0; i < numArray.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < (numArray.length - i -1); j ++) {
      if (numArray[j] > numArray[j+1]) {
        let temp = numArray[j];
        numArray[j] = numArray[j+1];
        numArray[j+1] = temp;
      }
    }
  }
  return numArray;
}

Input[9, 2, 7, 12]

Output[2, 7, 9, 12]
